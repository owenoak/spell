--------------------------------

- if we haven't been "drawn", everything happens instantaneously
- if we have, our duration/style modifiers take effect

- syntactic sugar ensures that we always stay consistents
	- however it's most convenient to express the transform, everything else balances

- distinguish between base attributes ("scroll position") and all variants,
	so you can observe the base and all sugary variants will always trigger appropriate handlers

- for every noun/adjective/adverb/verb:
	- we have a "before change" and "after change" which fires code
		:after scroll position changes
			- update children...
